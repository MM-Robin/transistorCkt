The main objectives of this task are 
  -> to evaluate the output characteristics of transistor.
  -> to study and the transfer characteristics of the transistor BC546A. 
    We also graphically determine the transconductance through the transfer 
    characteristics graph at a particular operating point.
  -> Measure the operating point of the circuit and the AC-voltage gain.
  -> Measure the input and output resistance according to the half-voltage method for the output voltage.
